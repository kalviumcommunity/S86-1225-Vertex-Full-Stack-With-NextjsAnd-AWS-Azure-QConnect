This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Database Migrations & Seeding ✅

This project uses Prisma for database schema migrations and reproducible seeding.

### Key commands

- Create & apply a migration (development):
  - npx prisma migrate dev --name init_schema
  - or: npm run migrate:dev

- Reset the database (drops, re-applies migrations, optional seed):
  - npx prisma migrate reset
  - or: npm run migrate:reset

- Seed the database (idempotent upserts):
  - npx prisma db seed
  - or: npm run db:seed
  - Seed script: `prisma/seed.ts` (uses `upsert` and `Role` enum — safe to re-run)

- Open Prisma Studio to inspect data:
  - npx prisma studio
  - or: npm run prisma:studio

### Notes & Best Practices ⚠️

- Idempotency: The seed script uses `upsert` so re-running won't create duplicates; it also updates key fields to keep data consistent.
- Rollback and Production Safety: Always backup production databases and test migrations in staging before applying them to production. Consider taking a DB snapshot or creating backups as part of your deployment pipeline.
- Logging: When you run migrations and seeds locally, capture terminal output or screenshots and attach them to the project README for traceability.

If you want, run the commands locally and paste the migration & seed logs here — I can add them to this README for documentation and verification.
